Autonomous vehicle (AV) is an emerging technology, and older adults are expected to be one of the largest user cohorts of AV as it supports aging-in-place through freedom of mobility. As aging is associated with sensory and cognitive declines, older adults might have unique needs and challenges while interacting with AVs. Therefore, we aim to understand older passengers' specific challenges and preferences while riding inside a self-driving car and design potential interfaces for them to facilitate reliable and suitable communication.
